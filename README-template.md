## Overview

A random advice generator app

### The challenge

-   After fetching my data from the API URL i was able to display it on the UI but found it difficult to manually change the advice on button click, but then i noticed the request were cached and therefore always returned the same Value. So i passed a {cache: "no-cache"} in an object beside my fetch to bypass cachingand i was able to get my random data sucessfully..
-   I set my project to be responsive for both desktop and mobile use.

For better undestanding check my code.. Thank you.........

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

How to fetch, and render data to the DOM and i also learnt how to manually style my react components with vanilla css. I also got to learn how to know when data is cached and how to uncache it.

### Continued development

I want to get more better at my javascript and how to feth data to render to the DOM and to top it all i want to learn how to get better with writing clean reactJS code.
